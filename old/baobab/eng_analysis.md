1. Website Modernization.
We are looking to revamp our current website to make it more interactive and user-friendly.
Key updates should include dynamic tabs and an interactive interface that encourages visitor engagement.
The goal is to create a seamless and engaging experience for all visitors.

2. Regular Blog Updates.
I can provide full-length articles or outlines
will provide articles more frequently to keep our blog up to date.
It is crucial that these articles are published regularly to keep our content fresh and relevant.
This will require coordination with our content team to ensure timely uploads and SEO optimization.

3. Online Training Platform.
We need to develop a robust platform for the conference and training aspects of our services.
This platform should support
- e-learning capabilities, including
- webinars,
- live sessions, and
- on-demand courses.

It is essential that this platform is intuitive and able to handle concurrent users without compromising performance.

4. Social Media Management.
For our wealth management division, I want active management of our accounts
- Facebook,
- Twitter and
- Instagram.

This includes regular posts,
videos and interactive content to engage our audience and showcase our services.

5. YouTube Channel
Let’s create a YouTube channel for our firm.

This channel will host various formats of content, including teasers, broadcasts, interviews and event coverage.

I look forward to your creative ideas on how we can make this tool a dynamic way to engage our audience and attract new clients.

6. Brochure Update.
We need to refresh our firm’s brochure to make it more appealing to a younger audience.

In addition, we will develop detailed brochures for each division: wealth, finance, tax and training.

These documents will clearly communicate the unique services and benefits they offer.

Work on the graphic charter and logo
In addition to the above initiatives, I would also like us to work on redesigning our graphic charter and logo.
This work is essential to ensure visual consistency across all our communication materials and to strengthen our brand identity.
