how to run Rust Dioxus app in physical phone during development

We are going to run a Rust Dioxus app on a physical phone during development.

Steps:

1. Ensure your Rust app is set up with Dioxus.

2. We will use the `dioxus-cli` to build and serve the app.

3. We need to run the app in a way that the phone can access it, typically over the same network.

Important: The development server runs by default on `http://localhost:8080`. We need to change the host to `0.0.0.0` so that it's accessible over the network.

Steps in detail:

a) Install dioxus-cli if not already:

cargo install dioxus-cli

b) In your Dioxus project, you can run:

dioxus serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

This will build and serve the app on all network interfaces.

c) Find your computer's local IP address (e.g., on Linux: `ip addr`, on macOS: `ifconfig`, on Windows: `ipconfig`). It will be something like 192.168.x.x.

d) On your phone, connect to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.

e) Open a web browser on your phone and navigate to: `http://<your_computer_ip>:8080`

However, note that for mobile development, you might want to use the hot-reload feature.

Alternatively, you can use the `dioxus serve` command with hot-reload:

dioxus serve --hot-reload --host 0.0.0.0

But note: the hot-reload server runs on a different port (default 8081). So you would access the app at `http://<ip>:8080` and the hot-reload will connect to `ws://<ip>:8081`.

However, the Dioxus CLI might handle this automatically by injecting the correct WebSocket address for hot-reload. But if not, you might need to set the environment variable `DIOXUS_HOT_RELOAD` to the WebSocket address.

Alternatively, you can use the `--platform` flag to set the target platform to mobile web, but that is more for the look and feel.

Also, note that if you are building for mobile and want to use native features, you might need to use the `dioxus-mobile` tools. But the question is about running during development on a physical phone, so the web version is acceptable.

However, if you are building a mobile app (using Wry or Tauri for mobile), then the process is different. But Dioxus primarily supports web for cross-platform. For true native mobile, you can use the `dioxus-mobile` crate and toolchain.

But let's stick to the web version for simplicity.

If you are using Dioxus for mobile native (iOS/Android), then:

1. You need to set up Android Studio and Xcode for the respective platforms.

2. Then, you can use `dioxus build --platform android` or `ios`.

3. Then, connect your phone via USB and run the app.

However, the question is about development on a physical phone. For native mobile, the development cycle might be slower because of building for the target.

Alternatively, you can use the `dioxus serve` method for web and then wrap the web view in a mobile app later.

Since the question is ambiguous, I'll cover both.

Option 1: Web App (for any phone with a browser)

- Run `dioxus serve --host 0.0.0.0`

- Access via local IP as above.

Option 2: Native Mobile App (using dioxus-mobile)

Steps for dioxus-mobile:

a) Install the mobile target:

rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios   # for iOS

rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android   # for Android

b) Install the dioxus-cli mobile extension:

cargo install dioxus-cli --features mobile

c) For Android, you need to set up the Android NDK and environment variables.

d) Then, in your project:

dioxus mobile init

This will generate Android and iOS projects.

e) To run on Android:

dioxus mobile android run

This will build and try to run on a connected Android device (via USB debugging enabled).

f) For iOS:

dioxus mobile ios run

This will build and run on a connected iOS device (you need to set up code signing).

However, note that the native mobile path is more complex and requires setting up the development environments for Android and iOS.

Given the complexity, and since the question doesn't specify, I'll assume the web version is acceptable for development.

But note: If you are building a native mobile app, you might want to use the web version for quick iteration and then test natively when needed.

Another option for native mobile: Use the `dioxus-desktop` with Wry and then run it on the desktop and then later build for mobile. But during development, you might not be testing on the actual phone until you build.

Considering the trade-offs, the simplest for quick development is the web version.

Additional note: If you are using a physical phone and the web version, you might face CORS issues if your app makes API calls. You might need to configure CORS on the server side.

Also, if your computer has a firewall, make sure the port (8080 and 8081 for hot-reload) is open.

Summary for web:

1. Run: `dioxus serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`

2. Find your computer's local IP.

3. On your phone, open `http://<your_ip>:8080`

For hot-reload:

1. Run: `dioxus serve --hot-reload --host 0.0.0.0`

2. The app will be at `http://<ip>:8080` and the hot-reload WebSocket at `ws://<ip>:8081`. The Dioxus app should automatically connect to the WebSocket for hot-reload. If it doesn't, check the console for errors and set the environment variable `DIOXUS_WS` to `ws://<ip>:8081` when running the serve command? Actually, the CLI handles it by default by injecting the current machine's hostname. But since we are on a different device, we might need to override.

To override the WebSocket address, you can set the environment variable:

DIOXUS_HOT_RELOAD=ws://<ip>:8081 dioxus serve --hot-reload --host 0.0.0.0

But note: the `dioxus serve` command now has an option for setting the hot-reload address:

dioxus serve --hot-reload --hot-reload-address <ip> --hot-reload-port 8081

However, check the CLI help: `dioxus serve --help`

Actually, the `--hot-reload` flag enables the hot-reload server, and by default it binds to `0.0.0.0:8081`. But the client (the app) needs to know the IP address of the server. The CLI injects a script that by default uses `window.location.hostname` for the WebSocket, which will be the phone's own localhost. That won't work.

So we need to set the `--hot-reload-address` to the IP of the computer.

Example:

dioxus serve --hot-reload --hot-reload-address 192.168.1.100 --host 0.0.0.0

Then, the client will try to connect to `ws://192.168.1.100:8081`.

Alternatively, we can set the environment variable `DIOXUS_WEBSOCKET_URL` when building the app? But the `dioxus serve` command doesn't have that.

Alternatively, we can use the `--proxy` argument? Not exactly.

Since Dioxus CLI version 0.4.0, the `serve` command has the following options for hot-reload:

--hot-reload          Enable hot reloading

--hot-reload-port     Specify a custom port for the hot reload server [default: 8081]

--hot-reload-address  Specify a custom address for the hot reload server [default: 0.0.0.0]

But note: the `--hot-reload-address` is for binding the server. The client still needs to know the address to connect to.

How does the client get the address? The CLI injects a script that uses `window.location.hostname` to form the WebSocket URL. So if you are on the phone and the page is served from `http://192.168.1.100:8080`, then `window.location.hostname` is `192.168.1.100` and it will try to connect to `ws://192.168.1.100:8081`. That should work.

So if you run:

dioxus serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --hot-reload

Then, on the phone, you go to `http://192.168.1.100:8080`, the script will try to connect to `ws://192.168.1.100:8081`. And the hot-reload server is running on `0.0.0.0:8081`, so it will accept the connection.

Therefore, the command is:

dioxus serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --hot-reload

And then access from the phone at `http://<your_computer_ip>:8080`.

Make sure the hot-reload port (8081) is not blocked by the firewall.

If you have multiple network interfaces, you might need to specify the hot-reload address to bind to a specific one? But `0.0.0.0` is all interfaces.

So the steps are:

Step 1: Run the command above.

Step 2: Note the IP address of your computer on the local network.

Step 3: On your phone, open the browser to `http://<ip>:8080`.

You should see the app and any changes you make in the Rust code should hot-reload on the phone.

Note: Hot-reload works by refreshing the page when a change is detected. So the phone's browser will refresh automatically.

If it doesn't work, check the console in the browser on the phone for errors (like WebSocket connection failure). Then, you might need to adjust the command or firewall.

For Android native, the steps are more involved and require the Android development setup.

Let me know if you need more details on a specific approach.

To run your Rust Dioxus app on a physical phone during development, follow these steps:
Method 1: Web App (Recommended for Fast Iteration)

This approach uses a development server accessible via your phone's browser.

    Configure Dioxus for Mobile-Friendly UI:
    rust

// main.rs
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    dioxus_web::launch(App);
}

fn App() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        // Use responsive styles for mobile
        div { class: "flex flex-col min-h-screen",
            h1 { "Hello from Dioxus!" }
            p { "Running on your phone!" }
        }
    }
}

Start the Development Server:
bash

# Bind to your local IP address
dioxus serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --hot-reload

Find Your Computer's Local IP:

    Windows: ipconfig (Look for IPv4 Address under your active connection)

    macOS/Linux: ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

Access from Your Phone:

    Connect your phone to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.

    Open a browser on your phone and visit:
    text

        http://<YOUR_COMPUTER_IP>:8080

        Example: http://192.168.1.100:8080

    Enable Hot Reloading:

        The --hot-reload flag automatically refreshes the app when you save code changes.

Method 2: Native Mobile App (Android/iOS)

For a true native experience (slower builds):
Android Setup

    Install Prerequisites:
    bash

# Android targets
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi

# Android SDK/NDK (via Android Studio)
sdkmanager "ndk;25.1.8937393" "cmake;3.22.1"

Configure Environment:
Add to ~/.bashrc/~/.zshrc:
bash

export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/25.1.8937393
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

Build and Deploy:
bash

    dioxus build --platform android
    adb install -r ./target/android-artifacts/app-debug.apk

iOS Setup

    Install Prerequisites:
    bash

rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios

Build and Open in Xcode:
bash

    dioxus build --platform ios
    open ./target/ios/MobileApp.xcodeproj

        Select your device in Xcode and click Run.

Troubleshooting Tips

    Connection Issues (Web Method):

        Firewall: Allow port 8080 on your computer.

        Network: Ensure both devices are on the same network.

        URL: Double-check the IP/port in the phone's browser.

    Native Build Failures:

        Verify NDK paths in environment variables.

        Run dioxus doctor to diagnose mobile setup issues.

    Performance:

        Use the web method for faster development cycles.

        Switch to native builds only for final device testing.

Notes

    Web Method: Best for UI development with instant reloads.

    Native Method: Required for testing device-specific features (camera, sensors).

    Wi-Fi: A 5GHz network reduces latency during development.
